	abstract = {The diagnosis of sleep related disorders like sleep apnea, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, begins with grading sleep into stages to analyze the problem. The R\&K rules recommend dividing the polysomnographic record of sleep consisting of EEG, EOG and EMG into 30 s epochs and classifying them as Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Wake state. In this paper, data from a single EEG electrode are decomposed into its wavelet coefficients (Daubechies wavelet from 2 to 6). Instead of using statistical parameters like entropy, energy, etc. of the coefficients as features, the coefficients are directly applied as input to a neural network for classification. Prior to training the neural network, the high dimensional input data are reduced to its principal components. The proposed method helps in isolating Stage 3 and 4, rather than identifying them as a combined Slow Wave Stage (SWS). Best results were obtained using Daubechies 2 wavelet, with an overall accuracy of 86\%.},

The propose approach employs time–frequency analysis and entropy measures for feature extraction from a single electroencephalograph (EEG) channel. Three time–frequency techniques were deployed for the analysis of the EEG signal: Choi–Williams distribution (CWD), continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT). Polysomnographic recordings from sixteen subjects were used in this study and features were extracted from the time–frequency representation of the EEG signal using Renyi's entropy. The classification of the extracted features was done using random forest classifier. The performance of the new approach was tested by evaluating the accuracy and the kappa coefficient for the three time–frequency distributions: CWD, CWT, and HHT. The CWT time–frequency distribution outperformed the other two distributions and showed excellent performance with an accuracy of 0.83 and a kappa coefficient of 0.76.},

Four hours continuous three channel polygraphic signals such as EEG (electroencephalogram), EOG (electrooculogram) and EMG (electromyogram) from conscious subjects were digitally recorded and stored in computer. EOG and EMG signals were used for manual identification of sleep states before training and testing of ANN. The percentages power of the 2 s epochs of the digitized EEG signals from each of three sleep–wake patterns, sleep spindles (SS), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and awake (AWA) sates, were calculated and analyzed to select the manually confirmed sleep–wake states for each epoch. Further, second order Daubechies mother wavelet has been used to get the wavelet coefficients for the selected EEG epochs. The wavelet coefficients for the EEG epochs (64 data) were selected as inputs for the training the network and to classify SS, REM sleep and AWA stages. The ANN architecture used (64–14–3) in present study shows overall very good agreement with manual sleep stage scoring with an average of 95.35\% for all the 1,140 samples tested from SS, REM and AWA stages. This architecture of ANN was also found effectively differentiating the EEG power spectra from different sleep–wake states (96.84\% in SS, 93.68\% in REM sleep, 95.52\% in AWA state). The high performance observed with the system based on wavelet coefficients along with the ANN, highlights the need of this computational tool into the field of sleep research.},

	abstract = {Currently in the world there is an alarming number of people who suffer from sleep disorders. A number of biomedical signals, such as EEG, EMG, ECG and EOG are used in sleep labs among others for diagnosis and treatment of sleep related disorders. The usual method for sleep stage classification is visual inspection by a sleep specialist. This is a very time consuming and laborious exercise. Automatic sleep stage classification can facilitate this process. The definition of sleep stages and the sleep literature show that EEG signals are similar in Stage1 of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Therefore, in this work an attempt was made to classify four sleep stages consisting of Awake, Stage1 + REM, Stage 2 and Slow Wave Stage based on the EEG signal alone. Wavelet packet coefficients and artificial neural networks were deployed for this purpose. Seven all night recordings from Physionet database were used in the study. The results demonstrated that these four sleep stages could be automatically discriminated from each other with a specificity of 94.4 ± 4.5\%, a of sensitivity 84.2+3.9\% and an accuracy of 93.0 ± 4.0\%.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel wireless system (WS) that does not require skilled preparation for the automatic collection and scoring of human sleep. Twenty-nine healthy adults underwent concurrent sleep measurement via the WS, polysomnography (PSG) and an actigraph (ACT) in a sleep laboratory for one assessment night preceded by an acclimation night. The PSG recordings were scored by two experienced trained technicians from separate laboratories. Each recording was scored by both technicians to Rechtschaffen and Kales (R\&K) criteria. The WS and ACT were compared with each of the PSG scores and a consensus PSG score, and the PSG scores were compared with each other. Inter-rater agreement was assessed for each pair over all pooled epochs by percentage agreement, Cohen’s kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient. The WS agreement with each of the two PSG scores for sleep stages was 75.8 and 74.7\%, respectively. WS agreement with each of the two PSG scores for sleep/wakefulness was 92.6 and 91.1\%, ACT agreement with PSG was 86.3 and 85.7\%. The PSG scorers’ agreement with each other for sleep stages was 83.2\%, and for sleep/wakefulness was 95.8\%. The findings from the current study indicate that the WS may provide an easy to use and accurate complement to other established technologies for measuring sleep in healthy adults.},

Following optimum classification schemes, the sensitivity of the network ranges from 79.2\% to 87.5\%, while the false positive rate ranges from 3.8\% to 15.5\%. Furthermore, due to the operation of the ANN on time-domain EEG data, there is agreement with visual assessment concerning temporal resolution. Specifically, the total inter-spindle interval duration and the total duration of spindles are calculated with 99\% and 92\% accuracy, respectively. Therefore, the present method may be suitable for investigations of the dynamics among successive inter-spindle intervals, which could provide information on the role of spindles in the sleep process, and for studies of pharmacological effects on sleep structure, as revealed by the modification of total spindle duration.},

In the previous studies, EEG signals and EEG signals with EMG signals were used for estimating vigilance levels. In the present study, it was aimed to estimate vigilance levels by using EEG, EMG and EOG signals. The changes in EEG, EMG and EOG were diagnosed while transiting from wakefulness to sleep by using wavelet transform and developed artificial neural network (ANN). EEG signals were separated to its subbands using wavelet transform, LEOG (Left EOG), REOG (Right EOG) and chin EMG was used in ANN process for increasing the accuracy of the estimation rate by evaluating their tonic levels and also used in data preparation stage to verify and eliminate the movement artifacts. Then, training and testing data sets consist of the EEG subbands (delta, theta, alpha and beta); LEOG, REOG and EMG signals were applied to the ANN for training and testing the system which gives three situations for the vigilance level of the subject: Awake, drowsy, and sleep. The accuracy of estimation is about 97–98\% while the accuracy of the previous study which used only EEG was 95–96\% and the study which used EEG with EMG was 98–99\%. The reason of decreasing the percentage of present study according to the last study is because of the increase of the input data.},

	abstract = {This second edition of The Illustrated Wavelet Transform Handbook: Introductory Theory and Applications in Science, Engineering, Medicine and Finance has been fully updated and revised to reflect recent developments in the theory and practical applications of wavelet transform methods. The book is designed specifically for the applied reader in science, engineering, medicine and finance. Newcomers to the subject will find an accessible and clear account of the theory of continuous and discrete wavelet transforms, while readers already acquainted with wavelets can use the book to broaden their perspective.  One of the many strengths of the book is its use of several hundred illustrations, some in colour, to convey key concepts and their varied practical uses. Chapters exploring these practical applications highlight both the similarities and differences in wavelet transform methods across different disciplines and also provide a comprehensive list of over 1000 references that will serve as a valuable resource for further study. Paul Addison is a Technical Fellow with Medtronic, a global medical technology company. Previously, he was co-founder and CEO of start-up company, CardioDigital Ltd (and later co-founded its US subsidiary, CardioDigital Inc) - a company concerned with the development of novel wavelet-based methods for biosignal analysis. He has a master’s degree in engineering and a PhD in fluid mechanics, both from the University of Glasgow, Scotland (founded 1451). His former academic life as a tenured professor of fluids engineering included the output of a large number of technical papers, covering many aspects of engineering and bioengineering, and two textbooks: Fractals and Chaos: An Illustrated Course and the first edition of The Illustrated Wavelet Transform Handbook. At the time of publication, the author has over 100 issued US patents concerning a wide range of medical device technologies, many of these concerning the wavelet transform analysis of biosignals. He is both a Chartered Engineer and Chartered Physicist.},

   describes the distribution of power into frequency components composing that signal. According to Fourier analysis any physical signal can be decomposed into a number of discrete frequencies, or a spectrum of frequencies over a continuous range. The statistical average of a certain signal or sort of signal (including noise) as analyzed in terms of its frequency content, is called its spectrum.
When the energy of the signal is concentrated around a finite time interval, especially if its total energy is finite, one may compute the energy spectral density. More commonly used is the power spectral density (or simply power spectrum), which applies to signals existing over all time, or over a time period large enough (especially in relation to the duration of a measurement) that it could as well have been over an infinite time interval. The power spectral density (PSD) then refers to the spectral energy distribution that would be found per unit time, since the total energy of such a signal over all time would generally be infinite. Summation or integration of the spectral components yields the total power (for a physical process) or variance (in a statistical process), identical to what would be obtained by integrating

   as it fluctuates at an extremely high frequency. Obtaining a spectrum from time series such as these involves the Fourier transform, and generalizations based on Fourier analysis. In many cases the time domain is not specifically employed in practice, such as when a dispersive prism is used to obtain a spectrum of light in a spectrograph, or when a sound is perceived through its effect on the auditory receptors of the inner ear, each of which is sensitive to a particular frequency.
However this article concentrates on situations in which the time series is known (at least in a statistical sense) or directly measured (such as by a microphone sampled by a computer). The power spectrum is important in statistical signal processing and in the statistical study of stochastic processes, as well as in many other branches of physics and engineering. Typically the process is a function of time but one can similarly discuss data in the spatial domain being decomposed in terms of spatial frequency.},
